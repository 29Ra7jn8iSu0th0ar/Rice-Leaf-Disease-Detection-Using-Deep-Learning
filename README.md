# Rice-Leaf-Disease-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning
The Rice Leaf Disease Detection project uses advanced deep learning models like MobileNet V2, EfficientNet B0, Inception V3, and SVM with ORB features to identify and classify diseases in rice leaves. It works with a challenging dataset that has varied backgrounds, aiming to help farmers detect diseases early and improve crop quality and yield.
